Speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is the ability for a machine or program to identify words spoken aloud and convert them into readable text. 

Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary of words and phrases, and it may only identify these if they are spoken very clearly.

Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.

Sentiment analysis helps data analysts within large enterprises gauge public opinion, conduct nuanced market research, monitor brand and product reputation, and understand customer experiences.
